Hello everyone, my name is Alexandra. I am a sophomore at the United States Naval Academy, and am currently an intern at Northrop Grumman for the first block of my summer training. I am a cyber operations major, and I am trying to learn as much as I possibly can over these three weeks before I go into the Academic school year.
